# PermitNav for Go2-W

**PermitNav** is a rapidly integrated 3D navigation demo for **Unitree Go2-W / Go2W**, built with **Livox MID360**, **ROS2 Humble**, **FAST-LIO**, **FAST_LIO_LOCALIZATION2**, **jie_3d_nav**, and **Unitree SDK2**.

The name **PermitNav** comes from the original motivation of this project: building a working real-robot navigation demo in a very short time to prove that the system could run and to earn permission to leave for an internship.

This project is mainly intended to achieve a basic 3D navigation pipeline on a real Go2-W robot. It is an engineering integration project rather than a from-scratch navigation framework. This project is only meant to achieve a basic 3D navigation demo. My main focus is locomotion, and I have not worked much on navigation before. If bugs appear, restarting the system is probably the best first solution.

## Acknowledgements

This project is not a navigation framework implemented from scratch. It is a real-robot ROS2 navigation integration project built quickly on top of existing open-source projects.

We sincerely thank the authors and maintainers of the following projects:

| Open-source project | Usage in this project |
|---|---|
| [Livox-SDK2](https://github.com/Livox-SDK/Livox-SDK2) | Low-level Livox LiDAR SDK used to receive data from MID360 and other Livox LiDARs. |
| [livox_ros_driver2](https://github.com/Livox-SDK/livox_ros_driver2) | ROS/ROS2 driver for Livox LiDARs. In this project, it publishes MID360 point cloud and IMU data. |
| [FAST_LIO_ROS2](https://github.com/Ericsii/FAST_LIO_ROS2) | ROS2 version of FAST-LIO. Used for LiDAR-inertial odometry, real-time mapping, `/Odometry`, and registered point cloud publishing. |
| [FAST_LIO_LOCALIZATION](https://github.com/HViktorTsoi/FAST_LIO_LOCALIZATION) | FAST-LIO based localization framework. In this project, it is adapted for relocalization in a pre-built FAST-LIO point cloud map. |
| [jie_3d_nav](https://github.com/6-robot/jie_3d_nav) | ROS2 Humble based 3D navigation system with Web interaction, OctoMap management, path planning, and controller output. Used for Web goal setting, 3D map management, and navigation planning. |
| [unitree_sdk2](https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_sdk2) | Official Unitree SDK2. Used by `go2w_cmd_bridge` to convert `/cmd_vel` into executable velocity commands for Go2-W. |
| [OctoMap](https://octomap.github.io/) | 3D occupancy mapping framework used for 3D environment representation and navigation planning. |

This repository mainly provides:

```text
1. Hardware deployment and network configuration for Go2-W, MID360, and NUC;
2. System integration of Livox, FAST-LIO, FAST_LIO_LOCALIZATION2, jie_3d_nav, and Unitree SDK2;
3. FAST-LIO point cloud map saving, processing, and importing;
4. TF bridging from localization results to the navigation frame;
5. Forwarding /cmd_vel to the Go2-W SDK control interface;
6. A reproducible set of launch scripts and real-robot running procedures.
```

The core value of this project is short-cycle engineering integration, not proposing a new navigation algorithm. It connects multiple existing ROS2 open-source projects into a reproducible real-robot navigation pipeline for Go2-W + MID360.

The original algorithms, drivers, and core software capabilities belong to their respective upstream projects. Please read and comply with the corresponding open-source licenses before use, modification, redistribution, or commercial use.

## 1. Hardware and Network

### 1.1 Verified Hardware

| Device | Model |
|---|---|
| Robot | Unitree Go2-W / Go2W |
| LiDAR | Livox MID360 |
| Main computer | N150 NUC / Ubuntu 22.04 |
| ROS | ROS2 Humble |

---

### 1.2 Network Connection

A network switch is recommended:

```text
NUC enp2s0  →  Switch
MID360      →  Switch
Go2-W       →  Switch
```

Current IP configuration:

| Device | IP |
|---|---|
| NUC - Go2-W subnet | `192.168.123.99/24` |
| NUC - MID360 subnet | `192.168.1.50/24` |
| Go2-W | `192.168.123.161` |
| MID360 | `192.168.1.165` |

---

### 1.3 Configure Dual IPs on NUC

This project uses `enp2s0` to connect to both the Go2-W subnet and the MID360 subnet.

It is recommended to create a dedicated wired connection named:

```text
go2w-mid360
```

You can create it from Ubuntu Settings:

```text
Settings -> Network -> Wired -> Add Profile
```

Set the profile name to:

```text
go2w-mid360
```

Then configure it with `nmcli`:

```bash
sudo nmcli connection modify go2w-mid360 ipv4.addresses "192.168.123.99/24,192.168.1.50/24"
sudo nmcli connection modify go2w-mid360 ipv4.method manual
sudo nmcli connection modify go2w-mid360 ipv4.gateway ""
sudo nmcli connection modify go2w-mid360 ipv4.dns ""
sudo nmcli connection modify go2w-mid360 ipv4.never-default yes
sudo nmcli connection modify go2w-mid360 connection.autoconnect yes
sudo nmcli connection up go2w-mid360
```

Check the result:

```bash
ip -br addr show enp2s0
ip route get 192.168.123.161
ip route get 192.168.1.165
ping -c 3 192.168.123.161
ping -c 3 192.168.1.165
```

Expected result:

```text
enp2s0 should have both:
192.168.123.99/24
192.168.1.50/24

Go2-W route source address:
192.168.123.99

MID360 route source address:
192.168.1.50
```

Notes:

```text
1. The Go2-W subnet IP 192.168.123.99/24 should preferably appear first on enp2s0;
2. WiFi should not use the 192.168.123.x subnet;
3. If Go2-W can be pinged but SDK control fails, first check the enp2s0 IP order and possible WiFi subnet conflict.
```

## 2. Install Dependencies

### 2.1 Basic Dependencies

```bash
sudo apt update

sudo apt install -y \
  git cmake make gcc g++ build-essential \
  python3-pip python3-setuptools python3-colcon-common-extensions \
  python3-rosdep python3-vcstool python3-argcomplete \
  wget curl unzip tmux gdb net-tools iproute2 pkg-config
```

If apt is locked:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop unattended-upgrades || true
sudo systemctl stop apt-daily.service || true
sudo systemctl stop apt-daily-upgrade.service || true
sudo dpkg --configure -a
sudo apt update
```

---

### 2.2 ROS2 Dependencies

Make sure ROS2 Humble is already installed, then run:

```bash
sudo apt install -y \
  ros-humble-rviz2 \
  ros-humble-tf2-ros \
  ros-humble-tf2-tools \
  ros-humble-tf2-eigen \
  ros-humble-eigen3-cmake-module \
  ros-humble-pcl-ros \
  ros-humble-pcl-conversions \
  ros-humble-message-filters \
  ros-humble-octomap \
  ros-humble-octomap-msgs \
  ros-humble-octomap-ros \
  ros-humble-octomap-server \
  ros-humble-geometry-msgs \
  ros-humble-nav-msgs \
  ros-humble-std-msgs \
  ros-humble-sensor-msgs \
  ros-humble-visualization-msgs \
  ros-humble-robot-state-publisher \
  ros-humble-xacro

sudo apt install -y ros-humble-tf-transformations python3-transforms3d

python3 -m pip install --user ros2_numpy
```

Initialize rosdep:

```bash
sudo rosdep init
rosdep update
```

If rosdep has already been initialized, run:

```bash
rosdep update
```

---

### 2.3 C++ Library Dependencies

```bash
sudo apt install -y \
  libpcl-dev \
  libeigen3-dev \
  libopencv-dev \
  libboost-all-dev \
  libyaml-cpp-dev \
  libgoogle-glog-dev \
  libgflags-dev
```

---

### 2.4 Python Dependencies

FAST_LIO_LOCALIZATION2 and some map tools require Python dependencies, especially Open3D.

```bash
sudo apt install -y \
  python3-numpy \
  python3-scipy \
  python3-yaml
```

Install Open3D:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user open3d
```

If you encounter NumPy version errors:

```bash
python3 -m pip uninstall -y numpy scipy scikit-learn sklearn open3d

python3 -m pip install --user --force-reinstall \
  "numpy==1.23.5" \
  "scipy==1.10.1" \
  "scikit-learn==1.3.2" \
  "open3d==0.19.0"
```

Do not upgrade NumPy to 2.x. On Ubuntu 22.04, the combination of SciPy / scikit-learn / Open3D can easily run into ABI conflicts when NumPy 2.x is installed.

Check:

```bash
python3 - <<'PY'
import open3d as o3d
import numpy as np
import scipy
print("open3d:", o3d.__version__)
print("numpy:", np.__version__)
print("scipy:", scipy.__version__)
PY
```

If you see:

```text
externally-managed-environment
```

run:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user open3d --break-system-packages
```

If Open3D still cannot be found after installation:

```bash
echo 'export PYTHONPATH=$HOME/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

Check again:

```bash
python3 -c "import open3d; print(open3d.__version__)"
```

This step must pass.

Install dependencies for `jie_3d_nav`:

```bash
cd ~/go2w_nav_ws/src/jie_3d_nav
bash install_deps_humble.sh
```

---

## 3. Get the Code

Recommended workspace structure:

```text
go2w_nav_ws
├── src
│   ├── livox_ros_driver2
│   ├── FAST_LIO_ROS2
│   ├── FAST_LIO_LOCALIZATION2
│   ├── jie_3d_nav
│   ├── go2w_cmd_bridge
│   └── go2w_sensor_tools
├── third_party
│   ├── Livox-SDK2
│   └── unitree_sdk2
├── scripts
└── maps
```

Enter the workspace:

```bash
cd ~/go2w_nav_ws
```

---

## 4. Build the Project

### 4.1 Install Livox-SDK2

```bash
cd ~/go2w_nav_ws/third_party/Livox-SDK2

rm -rf build
mkdir build
cd build

cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig
```

---

### 4.2 Install Unitree SDK2

```bash
cd ~/go2w_nav_ws/third_party/unitree_sdk2

rm -rf build
mkdir build
cd build

cmake .. \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../install

make -j$(nproc)
make install

echo 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/go2w_nav_ws/third_party/unitree_sdk2/install/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

---

### 4.3 Build ROS2 Packages

In this project, `livox_ros_driver2` is built using its official build script.

In testing, `./build.sh humble` triggers colcon build in the current workspace and builds the other packages as well. Therefore, this project uses it as the main build method.

Run:

```bash
cd ~/go2w_nav_ws/src/livox_ros_driver2

chmod +x build.sh

source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash

./build.sh humble
```

After the build finishes:

```bash
cd ~/go2w_nav_ws
source install/setup.bash
```

Check the build result:

```bash
ros2 interface show livox_ros_driver2/msg/CustomMsg
ros2 pkg list | grep fast_lio
ros2 pkg list | grep localization
ros2 pkg executables go2w_cmd_bridge
```

Expected output should include:

```text
livox_ros_driver2/msg/CustomMsg can be displayed
fast_lio
fast_lio_localization
go2w_cmd_bridge go2w_cmd_bridge
```

If `./build.sh humble` ends with:

```text
Summary: xx packages finished
```

and does not contain:

```text
failed
aborted
```

then the build is successful.

`stderr output` during compilation does not necessarily mean failure. Many of them are only CMake warnings.

---

## 5. MID360 Configuration Check

Current MID360 IP:

```text
192.168.1.165
```

NUC host IP:

```text
192.168.1.50
```

Check Livox configuration:

```bash
grep -R "192.168.1" -n ~/go2w_nav_ws/src/livox_ros_driver2/config
```

The configuration should match:

```text
host_ip / cmd_data_ip / point_data_ip / imu_data_ip: 192.168.1.50
lidar_ip: 192.168.1.165
```

Check the network first:

```bash
ip route get 192.168.1.165
ping -c 3 192.168.1.165
```

---

## 6. Mapping Procedure

Before localization and navigation, a FAST-LIO map must be built.

---

### 6.1 Use the FAST-LIO Launch Script with PCD Saving Enabled

The script for saving PCD maps is:

```bash
~/go2w_nav_ws/scripts/start_fastlio.sh.pcd_true
```

Before mapping, copy or rename it as the active FAST-LIO script:

```bash
cp ~/go2w_nav_ws/scripts/start_fastlio.sh.pcd_true \
   ~/go2w_nav_ws/scripts/start_fastlio.sh

chmod +x ~/go2w_nav_ws/scripts/start_fastlio.sh
```

Enable PCD saving in FAST-LIO:

```bash
sed -i 's/pcd_save_en:[[:space:]]*false/pcd_save_en: true/g' \
~/go2w_nav_ws/src/FAST_LIO_ROS2/config/mid360_nuc_mapping.yaml
```

If the installed configuration already exists, modify it as well:

```bash
if [ -f ~/go2w_nav_ws/install/fast_lio/share/fast_lio/config/mid360_nuc_mapping.yaml ]; then
  sed -i 's/pcd_save_en:[[:space:]]*false/pcd_save_en: true/g' \
  ~/go2w_nav_ws/install/fast_lio/share/fast_lio/config/mid360_nuc_mapping.yaml
fi
```

To disable PCD saving later, use the original `start_fastlio.sh` and set:

```bash
sed -i 's/pcd_save_en:[[:space:]]*true/pcd_save_en: false/g' \
~/go2w_nav_ws/src/FAST_LIO_ROS2/config/mid360_nuc_mapping.yaml

sed -i 's/pcd_save_en:[[:space:]]*true/pcd_save_en: false/g' \
~/go2w_nav_ws/install/fast_lio/share/fast_lio/config/mid360_nuc_mapping.yaml
```

---

### 6.2 Start Livox and FAST-LIO for Mapping

Terminal 1:

```bash
chmod +x ~/go2w_nav_ws/scripts/start_livox.sh
~/go2w_nav_ws/scripts/start_livox.sh
```

Terminal 2:

```bash
chmod +x ~/go2w_nav_ws/scripts/start_fastlio.sh
~/go2w_nav_ws/scripts/start_fastlio.sh
```

Check topics:

```bash
ros2 topic hz /livox/lidar
ros2 topic hz /livox/imu
ros2 topic hz /Odometry
ros2 topic list | grep cloud
```

Mapping suggestions:

```text
1. Avoid people walking in the scene during mapping;
2. Move the robot or LiDAR smoothly;
3. Scan corridors, doors, corners, and stairs multiple times;
4. After mapping, shut down FAST-LIO normally and wait until the PCD file is saved.
```

The saved map is located under:

```bash
~/go2w_nav_ws/maps/fastlio_yyyymmdd_hhmmss
```

View the map:

```bash
sudo apt install pcl-tools
pcl_viewer ~/go2w_nav_ws/maps/fastlio_yyyymmdd_hhmmss/scans.pcd
```

Copy `scans.pcd` to the PC for map processing.

The PC side is responsible for:

```text
1. Auto-leveling;
2. Noise removal;
3. Converting the map to OctoMap using jie_3d_nav;
4. Exporting the processed localization PCD and jie_3d_nav map package.
```

See the PC-side README for the detailed processing procedure.

---

## 7. Import Processed Maps from PC

The map processing pipeline is maintained in a separate repository:

```text
go2w_nav_pc_ws（coming soon）
```

The PC-side project is responsible for processing the raw FAST-LIO map generated on the NUC. After mapping, copy the raw `scans.pcd` from the NUC to the PC workspace and process it in `go2w_nav_pc_ws`.

The PC-side workflow includes:

```text
1. Auto-leveling the raw FAST-LIO point cloud map;
2. Removing floating noise and outlier points;
3. Preparing the localization PCD used by FAST_LIO_LOCALIZATION2;
4. Importing the processed PCD into jie_3d_nav;
5. Converting the map into an OctoMap-based navigation map;
6. Exporting the final localization PCD and jie_3d_nav map folder back to the NUC.
```

After PC-side processing, copy the following files back to the NUC:

```text
1. big_localization_raw.pcd
   → used by FAST_LIO_LOCALIZATION2

2. jie_3d_nav exported map folder
   → used by the Web planner and controller
```

For the detailed PC-side map processing procedure, please refer to the README in the `go2w_nav_pc_ws` project.

---

### 7.1 Import the PCD for Localization

The processed map from the PC side should be:

```text
big_localization_raw.pcd
```

Create the target directory on the NUC:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/go2w_nav_ws/maps/localization
```

Target path:

```bash
~/go2w_nav_ws/maps/localization/big_localization_raw.pcd
```

Run this on the PC:

```bash
scp ~/go2w_nav_pc_ws/maps/final/big_localization_raw.pcd \
  name@<IP>:~/go2w_nav_ws/maps/localization/
```

---

### 7.2 Import the jie_3d_nav Map Folder

The OctoMap map folder exported by jie_3d_nav on the PC side should be placed under:

```bash
~/go2w_nav_ws/maps/jie_maps
```

Create the directory on the NUC:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/go2w_nav_ws/maps/jie_maps
```

Run this on the PC:

```bash
scp -r <PC-side jie_3d_nav exported map folder> \
  name@<IP>:~/go2w_nav_ws/maps/jie_maps/
```

Check:

```bash
ls -lh ~/go2w_nav_ws/maps/localization/
ls -lh ~/go2w_nav_ws/maps/jie_maps/
```

---

### 7.3 Check Map Paths

Check the map path used by FAST_LIO_LOCALIZATION2:

```bash
cat ~/go2w_nav_ws/scripts/start_fast_lio_localization2.sh
```

It should point to:

```bash
/home/luo/go2w_nav_ws/maps/localization/big_localization_raw.pcd
```

Check the map path used by jie_3d_nav:

```bash
cat ~/go2w_nav_ws/src/jie_3d_nav/octo_planner/config/nav_params.yaml
```

It should point to:

```bash
/home/luo/go2w_nav_ws/maps/jie_maps/<exported_map_folder>
```

Note:

```text
The PCD used by localization and the map package used by jie_3d_nav must come from the same PC-side map processing pipeline.
```

---

## 8. Start the Full Navigation System

The current project assumes that the robot starts near the origin of the PCD map coordinate frame.

If this needs to be changed, edit:

```bash
~/go2w_nav_ws/scripts/pub_initialpose_zero.sh
```

Start the system in the following order.

---

### 8.1 Livox

```bash
chmod +x ~/go2w_nav_ws/scripts/start_livox.sh
~/go2w_nav_ws/scripts/start_livox.sh
```

---

### 8.2 FAST-LIO

```bash
chmod +x ~/go2w_nav_ws/scripts/start_fastlio.sh
~/go2w_nav_ws/scripts/start_fastlio.sh
```

---

### 8.3 FAST_LIO_LOCALIZATION2

```bash
chmod +x ~/go2w_nav_ws/scripts/start_fast_lio_localization2.sh
~/go2w_nav_ws/scripts/start_fast_lio_localization2.sh
```

---

### 8.4 Publish Initial Pose

```bash
chmod +x ~/go2w_nav_ws/scripts/pub_initialpose_zero.sh
~/go2w_nav_ws/scripts/pub_initialpose_zero.sh
```

---

### 8.5 Localization Bridge

```bash
chmod +x ~/go2w_nav_ws/scripts/start_localization_bridge.sh
~/go2w_nav_ws/scripts/start_localization_bridge.sh
```

This node subscribes to:

```text
/localization
```

and publishes:

```text
map -> base_link
```

It allows jie_3d_nav and the controller to obtain the robot pose more reliably.

Note:

```text
The localization bridge does not perform map leveling or angle compensation.
Map leveling should already be completed during PC-side PCD processing.
```

---

### 8.6 jie_3d_nav with Controller

```bash
chmod +x ~/go2w_nav_ws/scripts/start_jie_nav_test.sh
~/go2w_nav_ws/scripts/start_jie_nav_test.sh
```

Check the controller:

```bash
ros2 node list | grep d1_controller
ros2 topic info /cmd_vel --verbose
```

---

### 8.7 Go2-W SDK Bridge

First, edit `start_go2w_cmd_bridge.sh` and set `network_interface` to your actual network interface name.

Then run:

```bash
chmod +x ~/go2w_nav_ws/scripts/start_go2w_cmd_bridge.sh
~/go2w_nav_ws/scripts/start_go2w_cmd_bridge.sh
```

This node subscribes to:

```text
/cmd_vel
/go2w_cmd_enable
```

After being enabled, it calls Unitree SDK2:

```text
SportClient::Move(vx, vy, vyaw)
```

---

## 9. Pre-run Checks

```bash
ros2 topic hz /livox/lidar
ros2 topic hz /livox/imu
ros2 topic hz /Odometry
ros2 topic hz /localization
ros2 run tf2_ros tf2_echo map base_link
ros2 topic info /cmd_vel --verbose
ros2 topic info /go2w_cmd_enable --verbose
```

Expected status:

```text
/livox/lidar has frequency
/livox/imu has frequency
/Odometry has frequency
/localization has frequency
map -> base_link is available
/cmd_vel has a d1_controller publisher
/go2w_cmd_enable has a go2w_cmd_bridge subscriber
```

---

## 10. Enable Robot Motion

First, use the remote controller or the official Unitree App to switch Go2-W to stair-climbing mode.

Open the Web interface:

```text
http://192.168.123.XX:8080
```

where `192.168.123.XX` is the host IP in the `192.168.123.x` subnet.

Set the navigation goal and start navigation.

If the Web interface freezes at `d1_controller_xy_tracking`, click wait.

For the first test, use a small velocity limit and make sure the surrounding area is clear.

After FAST-LIO starts running, operate the robot smoothly. If obvious localization drift is observed, stop navigation immediately and restart the localization/navigation pipeline.

---

## 11. Troubleshooting

### 11.1 `./build.sh humble` Permission Denied

Run:

```bash
cd ~/go2w_nav_ws/src/livox_ros_driver2
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh humble
```

Do not use:

```bash
sudo ./build.sh humble
```

---

### 11.2 Livox Error When Running Plain `colcon build --symlink-install`

This project recommends:

```bash
cd ~/go2w_nav_ws/src/livox_ros_driver2
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
./build.sh humble
```

This script triggers the build of the current workspace.

It is not recommended to use plain:

```bash
colcon build --symlink-install
```

as the main build method.

---

### 11.3 Many `stderr output` Messages During Build

If the final output is:

```text
Summary: xx packages finished
```

and does not contain:

```text
failed
aborted
```

then the build is usually successful.

Common warnings include:

```text
DISTRO_ROS / ROS_EDITION unused
rapidjson warning
boost bind deprecated
PCL_ROOT policy warning
```

These warnings do not affect normal running.

---

### 11.4 Open3D Cannot Be Found

Check:

```bash
python3 -c "import open3d; print(open3d.__version__)"
```

If it fails:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user open3d --break-system-packages
echo 'export PYTHONPATH=$HOME/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

---

### 11.5 Go2-W Can Be Pinged but Cannot Be Controlled

Check the IP order on `enp2s0`:

```bash
ip -br addr show enp2s0
```

Recommended order:

```text
192.168.123.99/24 192.168.1.50/24
```

Also make sure WiFi is not using:

```text
192.168.123.x
```

---

### 11.6 A Path Exists but `/cmd_vel` Is Missing

Check:

```bash
ros2 node list | grep d1_controller
```

If it is not running, make sure `start_jie_nav_test.sh` starts the controller with:

```text
launch_controller:=true
```

---

### 11.7 Robot Position Is Incorrect in the Web Interface

Check:

```bash
ros2 run tf2_ros tf2_echo map base_link

### 11.8 The Robot Does Not Move

Check:

```bash
ros2 node list | grep go2w_cmd_bridge
ros2 topic info /cmd_vel --verbose
ros2 topic info /go2w_cmd_enable --verbose
```

Make sure motion is enabled:

```bash
ros2 topic pub --once /go2w_cmd_enable std_msgs/msg/Bool "{data: true}"
```

If it still does not move, test `/go2w_test_cmd_vel` separately to confirm that the SDK bridge can control the robot.

### 11.9 Error When Configuring Dual IPs: `method=manual is not allowed when ipv4.addresses is empty`

Do not run this first:

```bash
sudo nmcli connection modify go2w-mid360 ipv4.method manual
```

At that moment, the address field is empty, and NetworkManager does not allow switching to manual mode.

Follow the order in Section 1.3:

```bash
sudo nmcli connection add type ethernet ifname enp2s0 con-name go2w-mid360
sudo nmcli connection modify go2w-mid360 ipv4.addresses "192.168.123.99/24,192.168.1.50/24"
sudo nmcli connection modify go2w-mid360 ipv4.method manual
```

Set the addresses first, then set the method to manual.
